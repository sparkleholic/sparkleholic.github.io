# things that do not change over time
  
A photo I took years ago.
It was a time of many worries and an uncertain future.
The time I spent with my family to get away from the pain of worry for a while.

Even after several years have passed
I am still standing in the troubles of life.

It doesn't happen that someone in the world solves it for me
I have to deal with my life on my own.

Nothing can be solved just by worrying.
Time flows equally for everyone.

At one time, I used to think that worrying was an unavoidable gateway to living in the world.
But little thought.

Too many worries in a short life seem to remain as regrets over time.
